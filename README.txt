Mythbuntu based theme.
In TVguide Shrinking spaces betwen the lines allows to list nine channels instead of seven.
In Recordings view I added progress bars and percentages that visualizes visited parts of the recordings.
This is my personal default theme hence some files myght not fit with your needs.
