Mythbuntu based theme.
In TVguide by shrinking spaces betwen the lines let to list nine channels instead of seven.
In Recordings view I added progress bars and percentages that visualizes visited parts of the recordings.
In Recordings descriptions exceeding the given space are smoothly scrolled down and up.
This is my personal default theme hence some files myght not fit with your needs (eg. Kody button) feel free to modify upon your needs.
